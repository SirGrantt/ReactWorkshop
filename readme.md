# Git'R(eact) Done React Workshop

Welcome to the Git'R Done React Workshop! Whether you have never worked with React before, or you are using it daily, my hope is that this workshop will have something for you. We are going to cover:

- setting up a new project (we are going to use parcel :package::smile:)
- the fundamental parts of a React app (where the magic happens :milky_way:)
- the different ways you can create and manage components (whew there are a lot :open_mouth:)
- the basics of state and event management (data binding!) :wrench:
- new features in React 16 (ooo shiny :sparkles:)
- styling using styled-components :nail_care:
- testing using jest and enzyme :microscope:

As a way to interactively learn these things, we are going to be building the world's best Todo list. :earth_americas::scroll::pencil2:

So if you are ready to become a React Ninja:atom_symbol: then make sure you have everything listed below, and lets Git'R(eact) Done!

## What should you have with you?

- Your laptop
- Node installed on your machine (At least Node 8 so that we don't have any version issues)
- Git installed on your machine
- This repo cloned down onto your machine
- Parcel installed globally on your machine (npm install -g parcel-bundler)
- A JSX Friendly editor (I recommend Visual Studio Code)
- React Developer Tools installed on your browser (Use Chrome so we are all on the same page)
- A good attitude! We have a lot to cover, and we are going to learn a lot! So lets have fun with it!

## Are you Ready?

After you have this repo cloned onto your computer and have everything mentioned above, change directory in the start folder. From there run

```
npm install
```

and then

```
npm start
```

You should see the terminal indicate that the server is running. Visit the localhost it indicates (likely localhost:1234) and you should see a Hello World!. If you do then you are all set to begin the workshop.

See you all soon!
