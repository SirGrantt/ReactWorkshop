# Git'R(eact) Done React Workshop

Welcome to the Git'R Done React Workshop! Whether you have never worked with React before, or you are using it daily, my hope is that this workshop will have something for you. We are going to cover:

- setting up a new project (we are going to use parcel :package::smile:)
- the fundamental parts of a React app (where the magic happens :milky_way:)
- the different ways you can create and manage components (whew there are a lot :open_mouth:)
- the basics of state and event management :wrench:
- new features in React 16 (ooo shiny :sparkles:)
- styling using styled-components :nail_care:
- testing using jest and enzyme :microscope:

As a way to interactively learn these things, we are going to be building the world's best Todo list. :earth_americas::scroll::pencil2:

So if you are ready to become a React Ninja:atom_symbol: then make sure you have everything listed below, and lets Git'R(eact) Done!
